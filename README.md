# Go Learning Journal

Welcome to my Go learning repository! Here I document and store code examples and notes from what Iâ€™ve learned while studying Go. Each folder represents a different topic or concept.

## Topics Covered
- [Dependency Injection](./DependencyInjection/README.md): Learn how to use DI in Go for more modular and testable code.
- [Concurrency](./Concurrency/README.md): Examples and concepts on Go's concurrency model using Goroutines and Channels.
- [Iterators](./Iterators/README.md): How to implement and use iterators in Go for efficient data processing.
- [Context](./Context/README.md): Understand Go's `context` package for managing cancellation, deadlines, and scoped values.

- [Error Handling](./ErrorHandling/README.md): Effective strategies for handling errors in Go, including custom error types.
- [Testing](./Testing/README.md): Unit testing, mock testing, and other testing strategies in Go.
- [Naming Conventions](./NamingConvention/README.md): Essential naming conventions in Go for writing clean, readable, and maintainable code.
